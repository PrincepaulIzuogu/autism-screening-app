## üß† Autism Screening App
The Autism Screening App is a web-based tool designed to support early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in children through behavioral and physiological cues. It leverages gaze tracking and pupillometry‚Äîanalyzing pupil size and eye movement‚Äîcombined with emotional stimuli, to gather useful screening data that can aid in clinical assessments.

***Features***
**1. Emotion-Based Screening**
Presents a sequence of seven emotional expressions:
Happy, Cry, Surprised, Angry, Fear, Love, Neutral

Each emotion is shown for a fixed time while the system records eye movement and pupil size.

**2. Custom Stimuli Support**
Upload your own GIFs or videos for each emotion through the Upload Media page.

Choose which media to use (default or custom) in the Manage Stimuli dashboard.

**3. Real-Time Face and Pupil Tracking**
Uses MediaPipe FaceMesh to detect face landmarks and pupils.

Tracks gaze direction and pupil size live using the webcam.

**4. WebSocket-Powered Data Streaming**
Continuously sends frame data from each session to the backend for processing.

Data includes gaze direction and pupil metrics for each stimulus shown.

**5. ASD Detection Logic**
Analyzes user responses across all stimuli.

Uses simple rule-based logic to suggest:

Signs of ASD detected

No concerning signs detected

No data available

**6. Session Report**
Automatically redirects to a Reports page at the end of a screening.

Shows detailed results with metrics for each emotion shown.

**7. User Account System**
Register, verify email, log in securely using JWT tokens.

Forgot password and email verification workflows included.
